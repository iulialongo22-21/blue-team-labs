# SOC Incident Response Lab

This repository contains hands-on Security Operations Center (SOC) style
incident investigations performed on a Linux environment.

The focus of this lab is authentication log analysis, detection of suspicious
activity, and basic incident response actions.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Linux authentication log analysis (`/var/log/auth.log`)
- Detection of SSH brute-force and credential abuse attempts
- Use of common SOC command-line tools (grep, awk, sort)
- Incident documentation and reporting
- Basic containment using firewall rules (UFW)
